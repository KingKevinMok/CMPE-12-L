What did you learn in this lab?

The thing I learned most in this lab was how to build this circuit and how the gates relate to one another. What I mean is that the gates all have a relation to one another. Depending on how you organize and build the circuits with the logic gates, they are able to input a specific pattern given by the truth table in order to work. In the end, this showed me basics of computer engineering as kind of like building a puzzle. It also taught me how time consuming this course is as I spent some time in this lab, like 3 hours in a span of 5 days showing me what is in store for me and that I should take this class seriously. I am currently taking it seriously right now, but I need to spend time and effort whether it would be labs or learning the material.

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?

The thing that worked the best was the TA's. They were really helpful and they so=pent time actually helping the students when neccessary. I also liked how organized the 1st real lab of the quarter as it gave us a clear goal and clear instructions making it easier to complete the lab. The biggest issue I encountered in this lab was figuring out how to use MMLogic becuase of the fact that the tutorial would not pop-up. Without the tutorial, I was experimenting with the application and tha ttook some time. Also I was really confused in the beginning with the no signal or no receiver, maybe it was me being stupid, but it would have helped if teh tutorial was there for us to use in the beginning.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?

The biggest change I would want for this lab is truthfully find a better application than MMLogic. The application was usable, however it came with many flaws. The first obviously would be the fact that the tutorial was not poping up forcing me to learn all the functions of logic by experimenting. Another thing was the fact that you cannot edit the size of the gates or textboxes making it very aggravating especially when typing comments. I am very used to typing straight and it is annoying to make a new box to every time the sentence strays of the page. Another issue was the fact that you had to be perfect when connecting the gates with the wires as sometimes it would not register. Another thing was having keyboard shortcuts for all the gates as it is tedious to click on palette to change gate and clikc on screen to place.
