The text of your prompts are stored in the processor’s memory. After assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings are stored?

The range of addresseses in which these strings are stored is 0xffffffff.

What were the learning objectives of this lab?

The learning objectives of this lab was to get students used to programming using assembly language in the Mars application as that is where we wil be doing the rest of our labs in. Students should be able to create a prgoram which enables them to create triangles when you give the program a certain length and number of triangles to produce. Also to get us to understand syscall and registers to use this program.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?

No I did not find or encounter any issues in this lab. However I did not find this lab enjoyable because I was basically learning a new language and it was quite frustrating to learn. The reason for this was the fact that you basically have to tell Mars Mips everythign to do unlike in Jaca or Python where you can tell them to increment a space each new line with a simple space+= space. You had to make a new function in order to make it increment or decrement spaces. Sometimes the program would not run or loop if you did not put li a register 0. And also the fact that if you made an accidental infinte loop, you were unable to stop the program and had to force quit from task manager. It was frustrating, but I did get better and learn some basics about Mips. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?

The lab was perfect the way it is. I just we could have sample code to how programs should be written in our flies. Not give us the answer, but give us sample codes so I could understand how the code looks like. Because the videos and book does not teach you everything. It would be nice to have a sample code that was not the answer, so it could help us understand and how to write the programs. I did like the videos and book you offered us however as they were nice tools to have so we were not going into Mars MIPS not completely blind. 

Did you collaborate with anyone on this lab? Please list who you collaborated with and the nature of your collaboration.

I did collaborate with people in the labs. I never got their name but how they helped me was debugging my prgram so I was able to print things in my computer and telling me that I needed to put a code in this place so that it could increase spaces each new line instead of incrementing the same amount of spaces each line. I did not work outside of the labs with people, but inside the labs is where collaboration was basically helping me debug or telling me I was missing something there I needed to encode without giving me the actual code so I could do it myself.
